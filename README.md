# Getting Started with Create React App

Here is the deployed web app: https://mnmuslims.netlify.app


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Deployment

For deployment we are using netlify which is a free hosting service: https://www.netlify.com.

In order to deploy the web app type `npm run build` in the terminal which will create a build folder. Once that command has been executed, drag and drop the build folder into netlify. Once that is completed you will have a deployed web application.
