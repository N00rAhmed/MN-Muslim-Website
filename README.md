### Deployment

For deployment we are using netlify which is a free hosting service: https://www.netlify.com.

In order to deploy the web app type `npm run build` in the terminal which will create a build folder. Once that command has been executed, drag and drop the build folder into netlify. Once that is completed you will have a deployed web application.
